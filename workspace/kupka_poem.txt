From orphic swirls, a vibrant birth,
Where color breaks from earthly girth.
No longer bound by form's decree,
But hues unleashed, for eyes to see.

Cadmium's kiss, a yellowed dream,
Where shades dance in a sunlit stream.
An intellect ablaze with light,
Kupka's vision, burning bright.

Beyond the disc, beyond the line,
A symphony of the divine.
Each vibrant stroke, a whispered plea,
To free the mind, eternally.

A violet's whisper, soft and low,
Mixed with ruby's fervent glow,
While chartreuse laughs, a verdant fire,
Lifting the soul ever higher.

With muted olive, calm and deep,
And salmon dreams where secrets sleep,
The canvas breathes, a world unfurled,
In Kupka's art, a vibrant world.
